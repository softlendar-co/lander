## technic
***overview** = take a look at every file related to current project*
***redo** = cut/rm current project and rebuild it*
## Developing works
***feedyday** = user comment, complain, feedback;*
***logoday** = logo updating*
## Shorthand Rules
- *shh = shorthand*
- **any 4 letter word that has consonant at 1st and 3rd letter and vowel in 2nd and at last an e** — cut e = shh
- **any word that has two vowels in the middle** — cut one vowel from those 2 = shh
- **any word that has two consonants in the 3rd and 4th places and one vowel in the 2nd place and another consonant at the 1st place** — cut vowel = shh
- use **data/import lng**

## Project Rules
- ***alwasys plan before act***
- **"scc" = stage & generate commit msg & update commit logs** — when user says "scc", run git add and stage all modified files then generate a commit message (do NOT commit)
- **in any chats if said listen then listen until said do it** — if user say listen then do not get on it until user say do it or mak it
- **when said committed** — know that it is committed
- **when said deployed** — know that it's live and run: fetch softlendar.com
- **when said data listen** — listen for detail
